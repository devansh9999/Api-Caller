# Api-Caller
Asynchronous API caller to generate around 2500 responses within 25 seconds based on AyncIO and Multiprocessing
Roughly 15x faster than synchronous calls (can be higher or lower depending on the API)

# Usage
- clone this repo
- do cd Api-Caller
- python Execute.py
- Enter the Api Link You want multiple responses from
- Since the response is a JSON, This api converts it to a dictionary and hence expects a key as input, Enter that
- DONE! You'll find a file named output.txt after the script finishes execution
